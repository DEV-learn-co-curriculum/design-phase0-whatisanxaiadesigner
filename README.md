# What is an XA/IA designer? #

> ## If a picture is worth 1000 words, a prototype is worth 1000 meetings.  
> - David & Tom Kelley, Founders of IDEO

Have you ever gone used a web product and questioned why a designer put certain content on a certain part of a screen? Or have you ever wondered why some websites place large images at the top of the page? That's the work of an Experience Architect (XA) or an Information Architect (IA) specialist. They create content strategy, structure the information and dictate what pieces of information users use and how.

Whether you know it or not, we're all familiar with patterns in design. Patterns are why you already know where you'll find the profile icon before you get to the landing page. XA/IA specialists use patterns to make sense of content through multiple channels (mobile, tablet, desktop) and services while matching users goals and business needs.

Usability.gov defines information architecture as a focus on **organizing, structuring, and labeling content in an effective and sustainable way.** "According to Peter Morville, the purpose of your IA is to help users understand where they are, what they’ve found, what’s around, and what to expect. As a result IA informs the content strategy through identifying word choice as well as informing user interface design and interaction design through playing a role in the wireframing and prototyping processes." (Source: Usability.org)

The organization of content can be broken up into these components:

*   **Organization Schemes and Structures:** How you categorize and structure information
*   **Labeling Systems:** How you represent information
*   **Navigation Systems:** How users browse or move through information
*   **Search Systems:** How users look for information

Seen many times in agencies and in-house companies, XD/IA professionals are a subset of UX Designers, focused exclusively on understanding industry standards for creating, storing, accessing and presenting information.

### **Part content strategist, part writer, part sorting guru, XA/IA Designers are involved in:**

*   business strategy
*   content usage
*   copywriting
*   how content breaks down by device
*   how the user will interact with the content on different devices
*   the constraints of the platform they're working on
*   the latest and greatest design patterns
*   machine specific use cases
*   concept testing
*   ideating
*   prototyping
*   usability testing
*   a/b and focus group testing

by [Tubik Studio](https://tubikstudio.com/) (7 min read) The World Wide Web contains a tremendous amount of information which is hard to imagine unstructured because a human brain wouldn’t be able to perceive any single thing. People got used to seeing content and functionality of the digital products as many of them are now: structured and easy to use. However, it doesn’t occur unintentionally. Designers and developers take a responsibility of constructing content and navigation system in the appropriate way for users perception. The science that assists experts in the content structuring is called information architecture. Today’s article is devoted to the essence of information architecture and presents the basic points every designer should know.
